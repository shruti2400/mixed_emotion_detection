# Face Expression Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing facial expressions using deep learning techniques. The project leverages the TensorFlow library and the `FER` (Facial Expression Recognition) module to detect and analyze emotions from facial images.

## Features
- Detects facial expressions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, etc.
- Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models for emotion detection.
- Supports image processing via OpenCV.
- Generates visualizations of detected emotions.

## Installation

Before running the script, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install fer
pip install pandas
pip install opencv-python-headless
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:
    Make sure to execute the script in an environment where the required dependencies are installed.
    ```bash
    python face.py
    ```

2. **Upload an image**:
    The script may prompt you to upload an image for facial expression analysis if you are running it in a Colab environment.

## Requirements

- `Python 3.x`
- `TensorFlow`
- `pandas`
- `opencv-python-headless`
- `matplotlib`
